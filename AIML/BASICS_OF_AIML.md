# 1.	Supervised Learning Models:
## •	Linear Regression: 
Primary type of regression model used for establishing a linear relation between dependent and independent variables.
## •	Logistic Regression: 
The models that works on the analysis on the basis of probability of an event.
## •	Decision Trees: 
Just like branches of a tree this model works on a flowchart that it creates on the occurrence of events.
## •	Random Forest:
This model works on the principle and integrates multiple decision tree for error free results.
## •	Support Vector Machines (SVM):
This model, SVM makes use of hyperplane to separate different data points.
# 2 .	Unsupervised Learning Models:
## •	K-Means Clustering:
It segregates cluster based on similar property.
## •	Hierarchical Clustering:
My merging or splitting of  clusters, it builds a tree.
## •	Autoencoders:
These are Neural networks used for unsupervised feature learning.
# 3.	Neural Network Models:
## •	Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):
It is a basic neural networks with input, hidden, and output layers.
## •	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):
It is used for designs and images and uses convolution layers.
## •	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):
These are used for sequential and temporal data,  recurrent connections for processing sequences.
## •	Transformer Models:
Used for natural language processing, including language translation and text generation.
# 4.	Ensemble Models:
## •	Bagging :
Combines multiple models to reduce variance, e.g., Random Forest.
## •	Boosting:
To reduce bias multiple models are integrated, e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting.
# 5.	Deep Learning Models:
## •	Deep Neural Networks (DNN):
Deep learning models with multiple hidden layers, typically used in image and speech recognition and other processing requirements.
## •	Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):
Used for generating synthetic data, such as images or text.
## •	Variational Autoencoders (VAE):
By learning probabilistic representations, new data points are generated.
